## Description

ATM $imulator is a project I worked on within the first couple weeks of learning back end development. I chose to include menu styling and text justification (center text, justify left, justify right) in this initial project which was an unessessary feature as far as functionality, but I was able to better understand some of the more abstract Java/object-oriented programming concepts by doing it.

Functionality-wise, the withdraw/deposit and update/address methods calculate and output the updated balance accurately, which is what you'd want and exspect from an ATM:

## Setup/Installation Requirements

#### You'll need:
1. An updated version of Java installed on your system.
2. An IDE that can read Java, like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)) or you can run it from your Windows Command Prompt (or the Mac/Linux equivalent of the Windows Command Prompt).
3. to download this repository and run the program.

## Known Bugs
- The 'Recent Transactions' menu does not show recent transactions.
- Depending on the IDE you use some menu styling may look different.
- The scanners remain open, which is not very efficient.
