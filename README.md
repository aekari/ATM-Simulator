## Description

ATM $imulator is a project I worked on within the first couple weeks of learning back end development. What I am most pleased with regarding this initial project was working out the menu styling and text justification (center text, justify left, justify right). This was an unessessary feature as far as functionality, but I learned a lot about Java and understood some of the more abstract Java/object-oriented programming concepts by working on it.

As for what I'm pleased with functionality-wise, the withdraw/deposit and update/address methods calculate and output accurately, which is what you'd exspect from an ATM:

## Setup/Installation Requirements

#### You'll need:
1. An updated version of Java installed on your system.
2. An IDE that can read Java, like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)) or you can run it from your Windows Command Prompt (or the Mac/Linux equivalent of the Windows Command Prompt).
3. to download this repository and run the program.

## Known Bugs
- The 'Recent Transactions' menu does not show recent transactions.
- Depending on the IDE you use some menu styling may look different.
- The scanners remain open, which is not very efficient.
